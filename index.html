            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
 			 <li>Video Games</li>
 			 <li>Cars</li>
  			 <li>Riding Motorcycles</li>
		</ul>
		<p>One of my biggest hobbies since I was a child is playig video games. I've always been fascinated with the ability to be transported to a whole other world of sorts.<br>
		Nowadays, I do play video games for leisure, but as it turns out, video games have been the perfect tool for staying in contact with my fellow veterans. Were it not for<br>
		resources such as Discord, and cooperative online video games, I fear that I would have fallen out of touch with these friends for life many years ago.<br>
		Some of my other hobbies include cars and motorcycles. I've loved cars since I was a kid, and having learned how they work and learning the ins and outs of them<br>
		in my free time, I am fascinated by the mechanical side, which bleeds over into motorcycle. I got my motorcycle license last May, and spent the whole summer<br>
		riding my motorcycle to Lewis to work at the Office of Technology.</p>
